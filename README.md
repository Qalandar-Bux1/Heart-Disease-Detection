# 🫀 Heart Disease Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease using machine learning algorithms. It leverages a dataset of patient attributes and applies **Decision Tree** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifiers to make predictions.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. Early detection can help in timely treatment and potentially save lives. This project uses two supervised learning models to classify whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on medical features.

## 📂 Dataset

- **File**: `heart.csv`
- Contains patient health records with features such as:
  - Age
  - Sex
  - Chest pain type
  - Resting blood pressure
  - Cholesterol level
  - Fasting blood sugar
  - Rest ECG
  - Maximum heart rate
  - Exercise-induced angina
  - ST depression
  - Number of major vessels
  - Thalassemia
  - Target (1: Disease, 0: No disease)

## 📊 Algorithms Used

### ✅ 1. Decision Tree Classifier
- Simple and interpretable tree-based algorithm.
- Suitable for datasets with both categorical and numerical features.

### ✅ 2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Instance-based learning algorithm.
- Classifies based on the majority vote from k nearest samples.
